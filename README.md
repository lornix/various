Various
=======

Various little things to test and try out idea and concepts.

* [Makefile](Makefile): A rather generic Makefile, but suffices to compile most anything

* [cling.cpp](cling.cpp): someone on [StackOverflow][1] was trying to figure out how to remove all
    references to his class.  Weird.

* [eniac_sqrt.c](eniac_sqrt.c): a rather interesting method used by the original [ENIAC][4]
    computer to perform multi-digit precision [square roots][2] using only adds, subtracts, and
    decimal point shifts (*10, รท 10 essentially) [PDF][3] available too. [More ENIAC info][5]

* [hello_c.c](hello_c.c): symlinked to `hello_cpp.cpp` too, to demonstrate the size difference
    created by compiling with `gcc` vs `g++`.  Less of a difference when using `-Wl,--as-needed`,
    but still... sheesh!

* [hello_cpp.cpp](hello_cpp.cpp): symlinked to `hello_c.c`.

* [inot.c](inot.c): Tinkering with `inotify` functions.  `./inot /etc /usr` will show you every
    access within /etc and /usr subdirs.

* [pt.c](pt.c): Some sample code from somewhere showing how to use ptrace to determine where a
    program is looping.  Interesting.

* [regex.cpp](regex.cpp): Tinkering with __C++11__'s regex class... kinda cool... kinda huge! Have
    a look at the compiled file size! (Even bigger with debugging symbols!)

* [sockclient.c](sockclient.c): Playing with sockets, connecting to my router.  No, those aren't
    my passwords.

* [sockserv.c](sockserv.c): More sockets... this time a server.

* [vector.cpp](vector.cpp): Some tinkering code (again, from [SO][1]), playing with various array
    methods, looking for which runs faster.  Also some foray's into steady_clock.

* [watchpoint.c](watchpoint.c): Another sample code from the same somewhere, showing how to use
    ptrace to monitor a particular memory address for accesses and changes.

* [asm1.c](asm1.c): Inline assembly.

* [dynwin.c](dynwin.c): Playing with SDL and window titles.

* [fac.cpp](fac.cpp): Recursion! Factorials.

* [hello_world_c.c](hello_world_c.c): Started out as classic __Hello World__, evolved into
    something weird showing various info.

* [memchk.c](memchk.c): Early Cavewoman era memory tests.

* [numjoy.c](numjoy.c): SDL, determine number of joysticks, some info and make it vibrate!

* [optout.c](optout.c): Decisions based on MACROS.

* [rdtsc.s](rdtsc/rdtsc.s): Assembly! My favorite! Reading the `rdtsc` repeatedly for timing.

* [sdltest.c](sdltest.c): Cavewoman era SDL window focus testing.

* [sdltest2.c](sdltest2.c): SDL, determine which OS we're on.

* [showmmap.c](showmmap.c): Playing with `mmap`, a simplistic hex dumper too.

* [test_macro.c](test_macro.c): Hello World with stringification.

* [testbt.c](testbt.c): Oooo! We can generate backtraces anytime we want!

* [testbuf.c](testbuf.c): I think this one was playing with differences between `char* str="";`
    and `char str[]={};` type usages.

* [testcairo.c](testcairo.c): Playing with `cairo` libraries, create a PNG with words on it!

* [tst_sigint.c](tst_sigint.c): Tinkering with signals.
